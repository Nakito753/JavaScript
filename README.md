# JavaScript
My learning of JS through courses, books and videos.

In this branch I will post code of what I learned and build.

The book I'm using is "Programming with JavaScript" by Jeremy McPeak and Paul Wilton.

The courses I go to are organized by "Advance Academy Bulgaria".

For the videos I will add the source to it and all the necessary links.
