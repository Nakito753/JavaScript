# DYI Build your dream project housing.
<!-- My learning of JS through courses, books and videos.

In this branch I will post code of what I learned and build.

The book I'm using is "Programming with JavaScript" by Jeremy McPeak and Paul Wilton.

The courses I go to are organized by "Advance Academy Bulgaria".

For the videos I will add the source to it and all the necessary links. -->

This will be DYI construction building helper, offering minimum required materials, optional materials, user selected materials

and local vendor providers for such materials. From building to renovating, prompt the measures, draw a bluepring, calculate

the minimum required materials and view your local suppliers.
